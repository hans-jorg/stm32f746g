Using a buddy allocator
=======================


Introduction
------------

The buddy allocator is a fast memory allocator. It also minimizes *external* fragmentation because 
all allocated sizes are rounded to the larger nearest power of 2. There is an *internal* 
fragmentation due to the area not used generated by the rounding.

Description
-----------

One of the simplest implementation uses two bit vectors, to store a binary tree.

* used: the bit is set if this block or the blocks below are used
* split: the bit is set if this block was allocated as two blocks with half size.
